    Can I count procedures?

    Yes! In fact, we can count <em>anything</em> with the app! The existing categories are shown below,
    but we can customize these labels/categories to fit your needs.  Just send us an e-mail at the.encounter.counter@gmail.com so we can discuss your specific categories.
    <ul style="padding-left: 2em;">
      <li>Adult: Inpatient</li>
      <li>Adult: ED</li>
      <li>Adult: ICU</li>

    How do we know the encounters are authentic?
  </h5>
  <p>
    Our current residencies simply <em>trust</em> that their residents will be honest about the quantity of
    encounters that they record. Your data will show the dates that they entered the encounters and the date that
    was selected upon entering the encounters.  The selectable date is meant to represent the date that residents
    encountered patients, so a resident can log days from the past accurately. Your best indicator of authenticity
    is to read between the lines for improbable or inaccurate activity. The app is also designed to operate with
    an administrator account who invites residents to the application.  The admin, by default, sees all user activity,
    but residents cannot see each others' activity.  The design is expected to reduce competition and the probability
    that residents would be encouraged to falsify data.
